Add LiveReload functionality to your development workflow with BrowserSync. It's an outstanding tool for the development and testing of responsive websites. Need to test your website design on a phone, a tablet and a desktop, no problem!

In a nutshell BrowserSync keeps phone, tablet and desktop browsers in sync across your local network and handles not only browser reloading, but also scrolling, mouse clicks and the capturing of form data. This means you can pick a single browser to test with and watch the other browsers magically update and reload as you make changes.

BrowserSync works on Mac, Windows or Linux and can run as a standalone tool or integrate with tools like Grunt and Gulp. In this article we are going to look at BrowserSync as a standalone tool and get to know some the functionality it provides. We will look at integrating it with Gulp in a separate article.
